# AI Prompt & Context Engineering Guide

---

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok respond to **prompts** (questions/instructions). To unlock their full potential, two key concepts are crucial:

- **Prompt Engineering** → Crafting clear instructions.
- **Context Engineering** → Supplying external data & managing context.

This guide summarizes key learnings, techniques, and best practices for both, along with model tuning parameters like **Temperature, Top-p, Top-k, and Output Tokens**.

## Prompt Engineering

### Concept

- The **art and science of crafting instructions** so the LLM gives the desired output.
- Works like explaining something clearly to a human for better results.
- An **iterative skill** → refine, test, and improve prompts.

### Why It Matters

- Boosts productivity across domains (doctor, lawyer, coder, designer, student).
- Helps non-technical users interact effectively with AI.
- Example: Instead of _“Write about dogs”_, a better prompt would specify audience, word count, and tone.

### Levers

1. **Wording** – use action verbs, clear structure.
2. **Role assignment** – e.g., _“Act like a doctor”_, _“Explain like I’m 5.”_
3. **Constraints** – define length, format, or style.
4. **Examples** – few-shot prompting to guide AI.

### Failures

- Long, unclear instructions.
- Persona mismatch (asking a doctor persona about a car puncture).

## Context Engineering

### Concept

- Managing **external information, resources, and actions** AI relies on.
- Adds **real-world knowledge** AI may not know.
- Example: If AI doesn’t know about _Muhammad Qasim_, upload his CV → this becomes context.

### Importance

- Many AI projects fail due to lack of **value addition**.
- Correct use of context = business efficiency & cost-saving.
- Enables **AI agents & workflows** (e.g., email replies, database lookups).

### Failures

- **Missing context** → no relevant data provided.
- **Wrong context** → irrelevant files/documents.
- **Too much data** → token limit exceeded, higher costs.

### Techniques

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** → fetch relevant snippets from large datasets.
- **Chunk & compress** → pass only necessary parts of documents.
- **Memory management** → preserve conversation history.

## Prompt vs Context Engineering (Comparison)

| Aspect              | Prompt Engineering                 | Context Engineering                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**      | Writing clear instructions for LLM | Supplying external data & context          |
| **Focus**           | How to ask the question            | What information to provide                |
| **Users**           | Domain experts, prompt designers   | Data team, ML engineers, platform team     |
| **Failure Example** | Messy or unclear prompt            | Missing or irrelevant data                 |
| **Best Practice**   | Short, clear, structured prompts   | Provide relevant, chunked, compressed data |

## AI Parameters (Model Tuning)

### Temperature

- Controls **creativity/randomness**.
- **Low (0–0.3):** Deterministic, factual (math, coding, Q\&A).
- **Medium (0.4–0.7):** Balanced (general writing, brainstorming).
- **High (0.8–1.0+):** Creative, diverse (storytelling, art, image prompts).

**Example:**

- Low → “The founder of Pakistan is Muhammad Ali Jinnah.”
- High → “Jinnah, the dreamer and architect of Pakistan’s destiny, founded the nation.”

---

### Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)

- Probability threshold filter.
- If `top-p = 0.9`, only the smallest set of words with ≥ 90% probability are considered.
- **Use Case:** Keeps answers relevant but flexible.

---

### Top-k

- Number-based cutoff.
- If `k = 3`, only the top 3 most likely words are considered.
- Less common in modern models (top-p preferred).

---

### Output Token Limit

- Controls **response length**.
- Example: Limit = 20 → “Muhammad Ali Jinnah is recognized as the founder of Pakistan. He was a …” _(cut off)_
- **Benefit:** Saves cost. **Risk:** Incomplete answer.

---

## How They Work Together

- **High Temp + High Top-p** → Creative, diverse answers.
- **Low Temp + High Top-p** → Reliable, accurate.
- **High Temp + Top-k** → Experimental, wild creativity.
- **Medium values** → Balanced (best default).

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Prompt Engineering = How you ask.**
- **Context Engineering = What data you provide.**
- **Good prompts + good context = powerful AI agents.**
- **Parameters (Temp, Top-p, Top-k, Tokens)** let you fine-tune creativity, reliability, and cost.

## Learning Roadmap (from Pennsity "Learn Low Code Agentic AI")

- **Step 0** → Prompt Engineering basics.
- **Step 1** → Six-Part Prompting Framework.
- **Step 2** → Context Engineering tutorials.

Everyone (doctors, lawyers, engineers, students) must learn prompt engineering as the foundation, then move to context engineering for real-world value.

## Market & Tools Overview

### Common LLMs

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** \~80–83% market share, strong tutorials & reports.
- **Claude (Anthropic):** High-quality, stable output, feels like a partner.
- **Gemini (Google):** Good but shorter responses, optimized for cost.
- **Grok (xAI):** Honest opinions, ranks lower but useful.

### AI for Media

- **Google Nano Banana (Gemini):** Photoshop alternative for image editing.
- **Google VO3 (AI Studio):** Video generation with sound, supports text-to-video & frame-to-video.

# Final Summary

Prompt Engineering is the **first gear** of AI → clarity, structure, role, and examples.
Context Engineering is the **engine** → providing external data, workflows, and real-world integration.
Together with fine-tuning parameters (Temperature, Top-p, Top-k, Tokens), they unlock the **full potential of AI for business and creativity**.
